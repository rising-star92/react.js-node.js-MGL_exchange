## The basic funtions:

### Wallet Creation with 12-Word Phrase
One of the key features of an on-chain crypto wallet is the ability to create a wallet using a 12-word phrase, also known as a mnemonic phrase or seed phrase. This phrase acts as a backup and can be used to restore the wallet in case of loss or device failure. The 12 words are randomly generated and should be kept secret and stored securely. When creating a wallet, users are typically prompted to write down and verify these words. It is crucial to keep the 12-word phrase safe and not share it with anyone, as it grants access to the wallet and the funds stored within.

### Deposit
Once a wallet is created, users can deposit funds into their on-chain crypto wallet. To deposit funds, users need to obtain the wallet's public address, which is a unique identifier associated with the wallet on the blockchain. This address can be shared with others to receive funds. When someone sends funds to the wallet's public address, the transaction is recorded on the blockchain, and the funds become available in the wallet. It is important to note that different cryptocurrencies may have different addresses, so users need to ensure they are using the correct address for the specific cryptocurrency they want to deposit.

### Withdraw
Withdrawing funds from an on-chain crypto wallet involves sending the desired amount of cryptocurrency from the wallet to another address. To initiate a withdrawal, users need to provide the recipient's wallet address and specify the amount they want to send. The transaction is then broadcasted to the blockchain network, where it is validated and added to the blockchain. Once the transaction is confirmed, the funds are transferred from the user's wallet to the recipient's wallet. It is crucial to double-check the recipient's address before initiating a withdrawal to avoid sending funds to the wrong destination.
